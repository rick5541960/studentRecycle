				The central concept of our project is to promote Recycling among students. How? <br/>
				<b>By connect them locally!</b>< br/>
				The students of Maynooth University can sell or buy used stuff on the fly. < br/>
				<br/>
				Unlike the many over-filled wall boards from the campus that < br/>
				many students will never get to stop and read from them,< br/>
				our project is a peer-to-peer e-commerce marketplace platform that< br/>
				allows users to make money on the go.< br/>
				<br/>
				Sell your stuff that you donâ€™t need anymore, but that it's in too good condition < br/>
				to be thrown away, like: books, home and office equipment or jewellery.< br/>
				You can advertise as well services like grinds. < br/>
				<br/>
				Do your part! Recycle NOW!
